WTF?!
=====

This repository simply illustrates the [tiny differences](https://github.com/henare/infomaster-minor-differences/commit/f4de5db2dde00c1f28b5b8990742a159008822c9) between [Infomaster](http://www.infomaster.com.au/) systems deployed by councils around Australia. Why are these tiny differences necessary and how much has your council paid for a button to be [changed](https://github.com/henare/infomaster-minor-differences/commit/f4de5db2dde00c1f28b5b8990742a159008822c9#L0L61) from `Agree` to `I agree`?
